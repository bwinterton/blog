So blogging is hard. That is my excuse. I know that it isn't a very good one, and you really could argue my point quite easily, but I am sticking to it! I sadly have not published quite as much content as I have wanted to recently (especially on the "code" side of things). And really, when it comes right down to it, I have no good excuse. Basically I have just constantly forgotten or blown off adding anything here. Who knows why? Laziness probably. But I really do enjoy blogging quite a bit. It's nice to get your thoughts out there written down somewhere. It gives you a sense of accomplishment, and, at least for me, gives a sense of contributing something of value to the world. 

That is really a large part of what I want to be able to do with this blog. I want to contribute quality, meaningful content to this world. Both in the 'normal' everyday though kind of sense as well as in the programming world that I live in at least 90% of the time. I feel like I have things to contribute that are of value, I just need to actually maintain that vision and motivation in order to get them out there! 

I started a blog post quite a while ago (it's probably been a month or so) that is currently sitting here as a draft. It's really quite a long post, but it definitely deserves the length. The post talks about the importance of understanding in a team setting, something that I have seen the effects of various times in the last few months. Which is exactly what prompted me to write about it. I like being able to take experiences out of my daily life and learn something from them as well as being able to write about them.

Now, I know I'm not the best writer, nor do I claim to be even semi-acceptable, and I am not the worlds leading expert in anything. But, I hope that someday, somewhere, someone will find value in what I have (and will) put here. 

Well, that's probably enough rambling for now. I really just didn't want to let another day go by without getting something on here. I know that if I try to make a habit about this I am much more likely to actually accomplish something. So here's to trying and hoping! 

I am off now to code up some tests between Go and the Java Spark framework. Just a little pet project to help make some decisions that need to be made in some projects I am involved with at work. If you happen to care and be interested, you can follow the project [here](https://github.com/bwinterton/spark_vs_go). Hopefully by the time you actually hit that link I will already have some final results up. Anyways, that all for now!
