You, dear privileged person, are witness to something grand. The dawn of a new era in the life of Brayden. 

*The Era of the Great Blog*

Ok, so maybe that is quite the overstatement, but we can pretend right?! Maybe this is the beginning of something grand and maybe it isn't, but I plan on enjoying it in the meantime. 

So welcome to my blog! This is where I plan on sharing several facets of my life with the people of the internets! This includes but is not limited to:

* My personal life
* Adventures
* Deep thoughts
* Projects
* Other code related things
* and basically whatever the crap I feel like

I will try to keep everything as organized as possible so that it is easy to find specific posts and topics. But for the time being I can't see a reason to maintain separate blogs. So it is all going to go here. Maybe, farther down the road, I will see that there is good reason to separate everything out. But at the moment that just seems far to exasperating and time consuming.

I have always wanted to blog but never really felt like I was good at it or could do it regularly. So one of my goals with this blog will be to keep it updated frequently. I can't guarantee any kind of consistency in my posts, but I can guarantee that I will try. Part of this blog is just to get over the fear of starting, which is something I seem to struggle with on a regular basis. 

Another part of what motivated me to start this blog is that I am currently involved in (and plan to become more involved in) several interesting projects (of the programming nature) that I want to document. I am planning on starting to write my own operating system in Rust! Which I am super excited about! And I am working on other cool things that I want to document and publish. I am excited to be able to start contributing to the wealth of knowledge and information available. I just hope that my content isn't completely sub par. 

So there you have it. This is just a quick introduction to my blog. I hope you enjoy what you see and find it of worth. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions you might have. I am happy to try to help out! I will try to get up some more posts in the next couple of days. I will try to write some introductory posts. Things like:

* My development environment
* More about me
* Introduction to some of my projects
* etc.

So be on the lookout for those! I am excited to get started with this and hopefully I learn to keep enjoying it as I go along. For now, thank you for bearing with me as I start.
