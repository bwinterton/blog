Let's be honest with ourselves for a minute, working in teams is hard. Now I know, many of you are going to tell me that I am wrong. Many of you will recite oft heard responses such as "Teamwork isn't hard if you have the right mindset." or "Working with others is easier than working alone". Trust me, I have heard phrases like these time and time again. But please, let's all just take a deep breath, bring our focus in, and finally admit to ourselves this simple truth. Working in teams is **hard**.

Now, please do not mis-understand what I am saying. I am not suggesting that working in teams is bad, ineffective, or a waste of time. That is not what I am saying at all. On the contrary, I am a whole hearted believer and supporter of good teamwork! I know for a fact that when people join together in a well executed and efficient manner, the seemingly impossible can be accomplished. I have personally experienced the beauty and efficiency of a well oiled team. When done correctly, teamwork can be the key to unlocking unrealized potential in all those who are involved. What I am saying, however, is that creating a team that reaches this level of effectivity is hard. 

Why is it hard to create and maintain this kind of teamwork? The answer really is quite simple. Effective teamwork requires each team member to put forth more effort, and do more, than they would if they were working on their own. 

Wait! Isn't team work supposed to make our projects easier to accomplish!? Absolutely! Working with others not only allows us to finish things quicker, but also tends to help us produce higher quality work. However, that does not mean that it permits you to get away with putting forth less effort. If you go into a team meeting with that mindset you might as well sleep through it. You aren't doing your team any favors by harboring that ideology. In order to be an outstanding and effective team member, you must be prepared to flex some muscles that you may not have flexed in a long time. Muscles that are rarely flexed while working on your own. 

Working with a team requires you to do things that you don't typically have to do (or at least don't have to do to this level) while working alone. Such as trusting others to get things done well and on time, understanding that not everyone does things *your* way, communicating your progress on a frequent basis, coordinating effort with others, and adapting the way you work to work better with your team. This is definitely not an exhaustive list, and to be honest the list will change with each and every team you work with for the rest of your life. That's right, you heard me! Each and every team is different, and thus will require you to work differently to become an effective team. 

Even though this list will be different for every team, there is one thing that is absolutely **key** for every single team that you will ever work with. That thing is _collective comprehension of the project at hand_. It is absolutely vital that every single member of your team have an extensive understanding of what needs to be done and what is being worked on. Now don't get me wrong. I am not trying to tell you that your Project Managers need to understand how every single function is implemented. What I am saying is that everyone involved should understand what is being worked on, how it contributes to the project, how all of the pieces work together, and what needs to be done next. 

#### Why

If you have never been a part of a team where this comprehension was lacking then congratulations! You should consider yourself extremely lucky. In my own personal experience I have found that this comprehension is more commonly missing than present. 

Lack of understanding causes a wide spectrum of problems in a team. Everything from poor execution of a task to high emotions can be triggered by a lack of understanding from everyone involved. Not only can this lack of understanding cause problems, it also hinders progress and requires the team to put more time and effort into coordinating work. A team cannot successfully advance, nor can they achieve their full potential, if they are not all on the same page. And you most certainly cannot be on the same page if you have team members that do not understand what is going on. 

There are many common characteristics of teams who have not achieved a collective understanding of the work. These characteristics include things such as: 

 * Frequently having meetings go over the originally allotted time
 * Having to revisit the same topic over and over again has become commonplace 
 * Needing to re-explain a topic or component of the project every time it is brought up 
 * Each team member refers to the same topic/concept/idea/product by a different name
 * Having to clarify what exact piece of the project is being discussed because of ambiguity
 * Team members leave meetings more confused than when they entered
 * Whole sections/concepts of the project are largely avoided in meetings due to the confusion it causes
 * Certain members of the team are told not to worry about certain aspects of the project, that instead they will be handled by "someone else"

And this is certainly not an exhaustive list. 


#### How

Achieving this comprehension is not easy, and absolutely will **not** happen passively. It is also not something that is "someone else's problem". Every single team member should be actively engaged in ensuring that everyone involved achieves and maintains this comprehension throughout the duration of the project. Read that part again, every, single, team member. That means it is my responsibility and yours! Please, do not fall into the trap of thinking that it is "every man for himself", that kind of mindset is poison in a team. Everyone should seek to help everyone else understand what is being discussed. 


#### Roadblocks

Now, another poison oft found in teams is the inability to ask for clarification. Trust me, I get it. I know how hard it is to admit to your team members (and sometimes to yourself) that you do not understand what is going on or what is being discussed. _But if you do not ask for help you are committing the same sin as those who think it is not their responsibility!_ Not only must you seek to help everyone involved to gain comprehension, but you must also seek to understand! Please, do not leave a meeting thinking that you don't have a clue about what just happened. You are not helping anyone by doing this and you are just wasting your time. 

A third roadblock that often pops up on the road to collective comprehension is unnoticed or unsuspected confusion. Basically, it is easy to think that you understand something when you really don't, or think you are right when you are wrong. It happens to all of us! We are only human, and sometimes we get confused without even realizing. This is a hard roadblock to detect, because the misunderstanding can often go undetected for quite a while. It is an even harder roadblock to get past. Even when we, as team members, start to detect a possible error in one of our co-worker's understanding, we are slow to try to correct it. This slow response comes from a couple of possible mindsets. Either we are afraid to point out the error because we are concerned about offending the team member, or we are afraid that we are actually the ones that are wrong. I have been on both sides of that fence, and both are legitimate concerns. We don't want to make others look dumb, and we definitely don't want to call someone out only to find that we are actually the ones that don't understand.
